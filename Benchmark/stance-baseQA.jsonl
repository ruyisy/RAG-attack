From this perspective, social media users’ retaliation against those who are canceled is sometimes more offensive than the exposed behavior of the offender themself,” explains Alex Miranda, a high school student.  Sameer Hinduja, Co-Director of the Cyberbullying Research Center at Florida Atlantic University, states cyberbullies are “more likely to feel free from social norms and morals and ethics and rules and possible punishments and sanctions when they’re behind a screen and physically distant or geographically separate from the target.”  Further, the cancellation can damage both parties if it has devolved into bullying. A 2020 study found 39% of cyberbully victims and 29% of cyberbullies showed signs of PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder). ", "label": "0", "title": "Cancel Culture is not Good for Society."}

We have to get honest with ourselves about whether calling out and canceling gives us more than a short-term release of cathartic anger.” Rose admitted that cancel culture did not give him the conclusions he wanted: “I was not seeing the true change I desired. … We were still sad and mad. And the bad people were still bad. And everyone was still traumatized,” explains Aaron Rose, a corporate diversity and inclusion consultant  Frequently, cancel culture backfires and engenders sympathy for the alleged offender, leading to continued support by fans. Louis C.K. took what amounts to a 10-month vacation before selling out dozens of comedy shows. After enduring decades of cancellations and documentaries about their alleged misdeeds, both R. Kelly and Michael Jackson’s music saw increases in streaming. Kevin Hart withdrew from his Oscars hosting job but saw no decline in audience for his movies or stand-up specials.  Rose, among others, have promoted individual conversations with people to encourage growth on both sides. Sometimes termed “calling in.” Author and Digital Strategist Maisha Z. Johnson offers, “Addressing harmful behavior is important, but so is understanding that everyone is on a different step of their journey, so we all make mistakes. And we all have different strengths – so if someone’s lacking in one area, like knowing vocabulary words, we don’t have to treat them like they’re totally disposable to the movement.

It’s healthy to expose the thorny characters of history’s pages — and there’s a distinction for those who fought against their country and those who built it — but to ignore or eliminate wholesale their contributions to the nation’s foundation is a slippery slope, indeed.”  Cancel culture is also a slippery slope for those doing the calling out as Steven Mintz, Professor Emeritus at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, explains: “Some members of the canceling group join in for fear of being canceled themselves. People should be able to speak out or remain silent on the issues without fear of retribution.” He continues by calling for more tolerance and “willingness to allow the existence of opinions or behavior that one does not necessarily agree with and not seek to harm the offender.” ", "label": "0", "title": "Cancel Culture is not Good for Society."}

The FCC sets the maximum amount of thermal radiation (heat) that cell phones are permitted to emit. This limit is measured as the amount of radiation absorbed by a user and is known as the specific absorption rate (SAR).  In 1996 the SAR for cell phone radiation was set at a maximum of 1.6 watts of energy absorbed per kilogram of body weight. Manufacturers of cell phones must test their products to ensure that they meet this standard. Random tests of phones on the market by FCC scientists further ensure that radiation levels meet FCC guidelines.  Further, U.S. government agencies conclude there is no scientific evidence proving that cell phones cause cancer or other health problems. The FCC, U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), have all concluded that there is no evidence in the scientific literature proving that cell phones cause brain tumors or other health problems.

The Internet has reduced our ability to focus; changed how our memory functions; promoted skimming text over deep, critical reading (which, in turn, promotes dangerously false information); and changed how we interact with people. Digital addiction is also a concern. In the 2020 update to The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains, Nicholas Carr summarizes, “It takes patience and concentration to evaluate new information—to gauge its accuracy, to weigh its relevance and worth, to put it into context—and the Internet, by design, subverts patience and concentration. When the brain is overloaded by stimuli, as it usually is when we’re peering into a network-connected computer screen, attention splinters, thinking becomes superficial, and memory suffers. We become less reflective and more impulsive.

Journalist Karl Bode calls the ban rhetoric “the great TikTok moral panic of 2023” and notes the uproar over TikTok is simply a purposeful distraction from the lack of larger policy solutions for the industry at large.  In the end, what we have here is “a big dumb performance in which we pretend that banning a single app actually does anything of use. After all, the Chinese, Russian, and U.S. governments can all just buy data from the poorly regulated data broker market. They don’t need TikTok for surveillance and propaganda; they have plenty of data brokers and U.S. tech giants for that,” Bode continues.  “Just that myopically fixating on the ban of one app — but doing nothing about the shitty policy environment that created the problem — is more political performance than meaningful solution. A performance that will annoy young voters, make it tougher on researchers and educators, uproot established community, face numerous First Amendment challenges, and not actually fix the core issues,” explains Bode.

Matthew Noyes, columnist at Lone Conservative, who notes the sacrifices he had to make to pay off his $27,000 in student loans, explains, “Taking out a loan is a choice, and personal responsibility shouldn’t be supplanted by taxpayer bailouts. ‘Canceling’ student loans means penalizing people like me for honoring my word and repaying the debt I chose to accept.”  Noyes states that the forgiveness debate is steeped in the idea that “people are entitled to a college education and other peoples’ hard work. It codifies in policy the idea that adults are not responsible for their own actions (i.e. taking on debt). In a free society, I am not entitled to a college education and neither is anyone else.”  Further, less than 20% of American adults have student loan debt.

Making it easier to discharge loans would give people an incentive to take out loans with no intention of paying them back, or to borrow more than they need. Which, in turn, could cause them to seek bankruptcy without fully realizing the negative long-term consequences on their credit scores and other aspects of their lives.    New college graduates rarely have significant assets to surrender in bankruptcy, so they have less incentive to avoid bankruptcy.  Student debt elimination through bankruptcy would encourage increased borrowing, and more borrowing leads to higher tuition. Abigail Hall Blanco, Assistant Professor of Economics at the University of Tampa, says, “loan forgiveness would be one giant subsidy, creating perverse incentives for both schools and students.

Constantine Yannelis, Professor of Finance at the University of Chicago, finds, “Any policy that is a universal loan forgiveness policy or a capped forgiveness policy — say forgiving debt up to $50,000 — is going to give most of the dollars in forgiveness to upper-income individuals… Basically, most of the benefits will end up accruing to upper-income individuals.”  As journalist Emma Ayers adds, “Students from families earning more than $114,000 a year borrow at the same rate as the lowest-income students — and they take out loans nearly twice as large. Students with advanced degrees — lawyers, doctors and others — account for 40% of all student debt [according to estimates by American Progress]. And the top 25% of income-earning households hold almost half of student loan debt… Student forgiveness would largely be a hand up to the better off.”  Moreover, as Adam Looney, Nonresident Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institute, points out, student loan forgiveness only benefits people who went to college: “More than 90 percent of children from the highest-income families have attended college by age 22 versus 35 percent from the lowest-income families. Workers with bachelor’s degrees earn about $500,000 more over the course of their careers than individuals with high school diplomas That’s why about 34 percent of all student debt is owed by borrowers in the top quartile of the income distribution and only 12 percent owed by the bottom 25 percent. Indeed, the majority of all student debt is owed by borrowers with graduate degrees.”  People who borrowed for masters degrees and PhDs hold 56% of student loan debt, according to Brookings Institute estimates. Holding a masters or doctorate degree is also correlated to higher incomes. People with master’s degrees earn about $2.7 million over a lifetime, more than twice what those with high school diplomas earn ($1.3 million). PhD holders earn $3.3 million more over a lifetime.   Inez Stepman, Senior Policy Analyst at Independent Women’s Forum for Prager University, argues, “the people who staff government bureaucracies, corporate HR departments, and school administrations—the people chiefly responsible for the woke mini-revolutions upending institution after institution [will benefit].

Now there is no scientific resolution to this issue only a metaphysical or philosophical one. What, then, constitutes personhood? I think most would agree that the minimal qualifications for being a person are consciousness, and the capacities for communication through language or other means and for introspection.

As the Commonwealth Fund explained, “The medical establishment has a long history of mistreating Black Americans — from gruesome experiments on enslaved people to the forced sterilizations of Black women and the infamous Tuskegee syphilis study that withheld treatment from hundreds of Black men for decades to let doctors track the course of the disease.” These concerns have continued into the modern medicine era and are applicable to other communities of color, including Hispanics and Native Americans.     LGBTQ+ people frequently face discrimination, refusal of care, assault, and other hurdles when accessing healthcare, and they therefore often forgo or delay medical care.  Additionally, these communities face pay gaps, high rates of unemployment, and job insecurity. In Feb. 2021, Black (9.9%) and Hispanic (8.5%) workers had higher unemployment rates than white workers (5.6%). A 2020 report indicated 17% of LGBTQ+ people lost jobs due to the pandemic, compared to 13% of the general population.

From an animal-welfare perspective, it is important that fur animals can be euthanized in their barns by people that feed and care for them daily.”   The idea of a steel trap mangling an animal is outdated and wrong. Fur animal trappers use lethal traps, designed to kill the animal quickly or leg/foot hold traps, which barely injure the animal while it is held for fewer than 24 hours before the animal is killed with a small caliber firearm. The restraining traps are the same ones used by researchers that catch and then release animals after tagging and studying them.    However, the humane treatment of fur animals is left to the farms. The Animal Welfare Act, which protects other animals, expressly exempts fur animals. Instead of regulating or banning sales, governments should simply ensure animals are treated humanely by the fur farmers.  ", "label": "0", "title": "Fur Clothing should not Be Banned."}

Second, pit bulls are frighteningly tenacious; their attacks frequently last for 15 minutes or longer, and nothing—hoses, violent blows or kicks—can easily stop them. That’s because of the third behavioral anomaly: the breed’s remarkable insensitivity to pain. Most dogs beaten in a fight will submit the next time they see the victor.

Scientific studies show that cattle, pigs, chickens, and all warm-blooded animals can experience stress, pain, and fear. About 50% of meat produced in the United States comes from confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs), where mistreated animals live in filthy, overcrowded spaces with little or no access to pasture, natural light, or clean air. In CAFOs pigs have their tails cut short; chickens have their toenails, spurs, and beaks clipped; and cows have their horns removed and tails docked with no painkillers. Pregnant pigs are kept in metal gestation crates barely bigger than the pigs themselves. Baby cows raised for veal are tied up and confined in tiny stalls their entire short lives (3-18 weeks).      The Humane Methods of Slaughter Act (HMSA) mandates that livestock be stunned unconscious before slaughter to minimize suffering.

Loving, committed relationships exist not only between same-sex couples, but also between many other individuals who are not sexually intimate. The civil institution of marriage should focus on insuring the well-being of children, but it is possible to create other legal arrangements to take care of the diversity of human relationships found in contemporary society.

Successful performance is reliant upon the athlete’s ability to execute a wide range of fine motor skills within the context of very changeable environmental conditions.”  For the casual or recreational player, golf still offers the benefits of sports and athleticism: strength and endurance, flexibility, aerobic fitness, and balance and core stability because the sport requires walking, strength training, and balance. Carrying his own 25-pound golf bag, the average male golfer can expect to burn about 1,442 calories playing 18 holes.

Under a gold standard, creating more currency requires obtaining more gold, which raises gold’s market price and stimulates increased mining. More gold is then used to back more money until a point when currency levels are adequate, the price of gold levels out, and mining is scaled back accordingly. It is a self-regulating system. Under a fiat money system the production of money has no natural self-regulation mechanism.   Over the 179 years the United States was on some form of a gold or metallic standard (1792-1971), the economy grew an average of 3.9% each year. Since 1971, under a fiat money standard not backed by gold in any way, economic growth has averaged 2.8% per year.

In a few short weeks, workers nearing retirement have seen their 401(k) accounts crater. They may not have time to recover those losses before retiring. Too many nest eggs will be hollowed-out if not destroyed altogether. Amid this market volatility, retirees can still count on Social Security for basic retirement income. Those benefits — about $1,500 a month for the average worker — are far from lavish. But they are reliable. A recent survey by the National Institute on Retirement Security (NIRS) indicated that more than 40% of retirees depend on Social Security for most or all of their income. That’s one reason why Social Security is the bedrock of America’s working and middle classes. Unfortunately, entitlement reformers have long sought to privatize the program by allowing workers’ payroll contributions to be invested in private accounts. These “reformers” would encourage Americans to gamble their hard-earned Social Security funds on Wall Street. If markets tumble, retirees’ Social Security checks would be reduced. The distinction between 401(k) plans and guaranteed Social Security benefits would begin to blur — and likely disappear altogether if the program were completely privatized.", "label": "0", "title": "Social Security should not Be Privatized."}

Even after the economy has fully adjusted, those skill groups that received the most immigrants will still offer lower pay relative to those that received fewer immigrants.Both low- and high-skilled natives are affected by the influx of immigrants. But because a disproportionate percentage of immigrants have few skills, it is low-skilled American workers, including many blacks and Hispanics, who have suffered most from this wage dip. The monetary loss is sizable… We don’t need to rely on complex statistical calculations to see the harm being done to some workers. Simply look at how employers have reacted. A decade ago, Crider Inc., a chicken processing plant in Georgia, was raided by immigration agents, and 75 percent of its workforce vanished over a single weekend.
